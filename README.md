# Enso Font

The Enso font was specifically created for the [Enso application](https://enso.org). It is based on the [MPlus1 font family](https://github.com/coz-m/MPLUS_FONTS), with certain modifications to enhance its suitability for Enso code. The following changes have been made:

- [The Full Stop Glyph (`.`, U+002E)](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+002E) has been adjusted with additional side spacing to improve its appearance in Enso code, such as `data.read`.
- [The One Dot Leader Glyph (`â€¤`, U+2024)](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2024) has been implemented as an alternative to the full stop glyph for use in regular sentences.
- [The Low Line Glyph (`_`, U+005F)](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+005F) has been modified to ensure greater consistency when used to surround words.
- Ligatures for `<|` and `|>` have been added to enhance code readability.
